# Dynatrace_MiniKube
Simple bash script to launch a Docker or KVM2 Minikube instance which will install the Dynatrace Operator + CR Yaml. 
It can also optionally deploy Hello Minikube and enable the MiniKube Dashboard for monitoring purposes.

This script is a WIP and is written for testing purposes only. Please keep in mind it was written primarly for personal use so please do not expect this script to work on your own personal workstation.
